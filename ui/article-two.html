<p> This is my second content.If a child is suddenly unable to cry, cough, or speak, something is probably blocking her airway, and you'll need to help her get it out. She may make odd noises or no sound at all while opening her mouth. Her skin may turn bright red or blue.

If she's coughing or gagging, it means her airway is only partially blocked. If that's the case, let her continue to cough. Coughing is the most effective way to dislodge a blockage.

If the child isn't able to cough up the object, ask someone to call 911 or the local emergency number as you begin back blows and abdominal thrusts (see step 2, below).

If you're alone with the child, give two minutes of care, then call 911.

<p>

On the other hand, if you suspect that the child's airway is closed because her throat has swollen shut, call 911 immediately. She may be having an allergic reaction -- to food or to an insect bite, for example â or she may have an illness, such as croup.

Also call 911 right away if the child is at high risk for heart problems or if you witnessed the child suddenly collapse.
